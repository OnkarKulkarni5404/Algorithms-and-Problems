### 1.	Use Python/R and Perform following on the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset  
i)	How many features are there and what are their types (e.g., numeric, nominal)? 
ii)	Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. (eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance  and percentiles
iii)	Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.  Plot each histogram. 
iv)	Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset.  All of the boxplots should be combined into a single plot.  Compare distributions and identify outliers.
